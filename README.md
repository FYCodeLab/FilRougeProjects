# Fil Rouge Projects — Data Repository

## Overview

The Fil Rouge programme at SupBiotech School of Bioengineering consists of supervised, semester-long research projects completed by Master-level engineering students. Each project integrates experimental methodology, engineering design, and quantitative data analysis. The programme aims to strengthen research autonomy, reproducibility, teamwork, and scientific communication.

This repository centralises datasets and supporting material generated through these projects to ensure transparent documentation, facilitate re-analysis, and enable reuse for teaching or benchmarking.

## Fil Rouge 2026 Project: **Design of a Semi-Automated 3D Printed System for Organoid Culture**

**Students: Florentine Cadot-Burillet, Camille Déjean, Claire Juge, Camille Martin, Romane Commerçon, Ludivine Demonceaux, Alejandro Martinez, Ariane Sarg**

This section contains the complete dataset and supplementary material for the 2026 Fil Rouge project tutored by Frank Yates and Franceline Juillard (SupBiotech). The project investigates the development of a modular, 3D-printed, semi-automated system intended to simplify organoid culture steps, including fluid handling, structural support, and environmental control. Students produced design files, performed validation tests, and evaluated organoid viability under defined conditions.
